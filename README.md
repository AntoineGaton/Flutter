## Reflections and Thoughts

- **1.18.2024**: I previously completed Dr. Angela Yu's bootcamp and was thoroughly impressed by her engaging teaching style, well-structured course content, and vibrant personality. Discovering her Flutter course, developed in collaboration with Google, piqued my interest immediately. Flutter has long been on my list of skills to acquire, and this course seemed like the perfect opportunity to dive in. The initial setup process was straightforward, and acquainting myself with Android Studio was a relatively smooth experience. As for Dart and the Material Design library, their intuitive nature and user-friendly framework resonated well with me, although I'm curious to see if this initial ease persists as the course progresses and the complexity increases. The thrill of getting a simple app operational on my Android device was quite exhilarating. I'm brimming with anticipation for what lies ahead in this learning journey. Here's to embracing each new challenge and discovery that tomorrow may bring!
